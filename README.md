Simple Java program to visualise searching and path-finding algorithms

## Description

So far, the program supports the Dijkstra and the A* path-finding algorithms, as well as the Breadth-First search searching algorithms.
The first two search 8-directionally, whereas BFS has been implemented as a 4-directional search algorithm.
